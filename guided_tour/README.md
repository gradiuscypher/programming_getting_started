# Guided Tour - Programming Getting Started
This guide will help you get started with automation and programming. The goal will be to start off with explaining some of the processes and tools and then introduce them through interactive programming projects. Each section of this guild will be its own file, so that any single file doesn't get too daunting to follow. This guide may duplicate or link to content in other files as well.

Due to personal preference this guide will focus on using the Python programming language. I'll do my best to ensure that the remaining resources in this repo cover as many programming languages as possible.

To get the best use out of this guide, progress through the links in the order they appear.

## Introduction to Programming Python
Python is a great programming language for quickly prototyping and solving problems, as well as building complex tools and systems while remaining easily understandable. Python has a large set of 1st party and 3rd party libraries to get things done. It's also very easy to prototype solutions because of its interactive interpreter. It's installed by default on most *nix systems, (and can be installed on Windows machines fairly easily) which makes it a great choice for building automation tools.

## Examples of Automation
Below are some projects and ideas of automation and programming. This should help brainstorm some ideas around what you could work on next.

* Your team has a shell script that everyone is interested in the output of, so you could write a program that pushes this data to a Slack webhook.
* Your IDS stack needs to update its rules once a day from various internal and external sources, so you could write a program to collect these rules and install them on your IDS sensors.
* You’d like to have all of your Zabbix alerts go to Slack, but Zabbix doesn’t have the functionality built-in. You could write a program that runs via Zabbix’s script execution that sends those alerts to Slack.
* Your group of friends like to share Youtube videos on Discord, and you’d like to collect all those videos in one playlist. You could write a program that uses the Discord and Youtube APIs to build this playlist.
* You’d like to scrape a website’s information and store it in a database for further analysis. You could write a program that parses the website’s HTML and sends it to a database.
