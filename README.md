# programming_getting_started
A collection of documentation to help security and IT engineers get started with programming and automation. Feedback, corrections, content, and topic suggestions are appreciated and welcomed. 

For more information on contributing, check out [this guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This is a collection of live documents and content will be updated as needed.

## Project Introduction
Programming and automation are great tools for any IT or security engineer (or anyone wanting to finish their tasks automagically!). They allow you to build new tools or to combine already existing tools. These tools can improve and speed up already existing IT and security tasks.

The goal for this documentation is to help introduce people who are interested in learning more about programming and automation. I’m not looking to teach someone how to be a professional developer, but looking to help encourage and grow new hackers, tinkerers, and builders. I’m looking to provide the tools and direction to inspire curiosity and passion for programming. Remember there's never only one way to solve a problem. I'll work to provide you with the tools to solve the problems you'll encounter. 

Most importantly, stay focused on continued learning. Keeping your skills sharp by programming frequently and always looking for new things to automate. Don't get discouraged when something doesn't work perfectly, coming back to a project later may expose a new way to solve a problem.

This document is only the start. After reading this, we'll go step by step solving some problems and providing examples along the way. Every step will be a building block to help you start solving your own problems with code.
